Requirements:
-------------
* Haskell and a couple haskell packages
* python
* R - lattice package
* something that doesn't mind / in filenames, because I used strings for file
  paths, not filename joins like I should have

To compile the simulator:
-------------------------

ghc -O2 --make sim.hs

Simulator usage:
---------------

usage: sim memberContrib memberDetriment selflessness splitChance numJoiners numGroups trials

Getting data:
-------------
* Edit run_test.py with appropriate parameters and run it
* the script will delete and recreate the directories
    * <test name>_data
    * <test name>_results
* in the data directory will be the raw output from each run of the simulator
* in the results directory will be the "matrix" R uses to generate its plot,
  which is also in the results directory
* also in the results directory is a dump of the parameters used in this test
